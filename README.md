# Bad Calculator

This is a calculator for simple arithmetic (add, subtract, multiply, divide) made using HTML, CSS, and JS. However, it has a twist.

Rather than always providing the correct answer it using a conditional function based on the result of a random number between 0 and 10 that creates a 50/50
chance of adding a random number between 0.0 and 1.0 to the final result.

Hence the name: Bad Calculator.

## Operation

For the calculator to work, simply add a number in both of the input boxes and then select an operation. Each has an event listener on them that, when clicked,
will perform the selected function on the input numbers.
